    "Disease_Name": "Bacterial Spot (Bell Pepper)",
    "Description": "Bacterial spot is a common and serious disease of bell peppers caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. It leads to the formation of dark, water-soaked spots on leaves, stems, and fruits, reducing the plant’s health and pepper quality.",
    "Causes": "Caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, which spreads in warm, wet conditions through rain splash, wind, or contaminated tools.",
    "Symptoms": "Small, dark, water-soaked spots appear on the leaves and fruits. The spots may grow larger and merge, leading to defoliation. Fruits can develop rough, scabby lesions.",
    "Treatment": "Apply copper-based bactericides, remove infected plant parts, and avoid overhead watering to minimize the spread.",
    "MANAGEMENT_TIPS": "Ensure good air circulation by proper plant spacing, avoid handling plants when they are wet, and disinfect tools regularly.",
    "Prevention": "Plant disease-resistant varieties, use certified disease-free seeds, and rotate crops to reduce bacterial build-up in the soil.",
    "Affected_Plant_Parts": "Leaves, stems, fruits",
    "Spread_and_Impact": "Spreads rapidly in wet, humid conditions, leading to significant yield loss and reduced fruit quality if not managed.",
